## 📖 Overview

This research project examines the shift in consumer trust from
traditional **celebrity endorsements** to **social media influencer
marketing**, focusing on the role of **parasocial bonds** in shaping
credibility and purchase intention.

The study empirically compares influencer and celebrity endorsements
under matched conditions to identify what drives trust in modern digital
environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Research Question

> **What factors shape influencer credibility over celebrity
> endorsements?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundations

This study builds upon:

-   Source Credibility Theory\
-   Parasocial Interaction Theory\
-   Authenticity & Transparency Frameworks\
-   Creator--Brand Fit & Identity Alignment\
-   Platform Context Effects (Short-form vs Long-form)

Modern credibility extends beyond fame and expertise to include: 
- Authenticity\
- Clear disclosure\
- Relatability\
- Identity similarity\
- Ongoing interaction

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧪 Methodology

-   **Design:** Cross-sectional survey\
-   **Platform:** Qualtrics\
-   **Sample Size:** 102 valid respondents\
-   **Generations Covered:** Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X\
-   **Analysis Tool:** SPSS

Participants evaluated one influencer post and one matched celebrity
post.\
Measures were captured using 7-point Likert scales.

### Variables Measured:

-   Authenticity\
-   Transparency / Disclosure Clarity\
-   Expertise\
-   Parasocial Bond (PSB)\
-   Credibility\
-   Purchase Intention

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Survey Data Summary

The dataset consists of **102 complete responses** collected via
Qualtrics and exported to SPSS for analysis.

### Reliability Testing (Cronbach's Alpha):

  Construct               Alpha
  ----------------------- -------
  Authenticity            .759
  Credibility             .747
  Transparency            .711
  Parasocial Bond (PSB)   .750
  Purchase Intention      .792
  Expertise               .609

### Key Statistical Highlights:

-   Parasocial Bond was the strongest predictor of credibility (β =
    .595, p \< .001).
-   Parasocial Bond was also the strongest predictor of purchase
    intention (β = .511, p \< .001).
-   Influencers were rated significantly more credible than celebrities
    overall.
-   High-PSB participants rated influencer posts substantially higher in
    credibility.
-   Short-form content slightly strengthened influencer credibility
    advantage.

The survey data confirms that **relational closeness, not just message
transparency, drives modern endorsement trust**.

## 📈 Key Findings

1.  Influencer credibility is primarily driven by parasocial bonding.
2.  Influencers outperform celebrities even when message content is
    controlled.
3.  Short-form platforms enhance influencer credibility perception.
4.  Authenticity and transparency support trust, but their impact
    operates through relational connection.
